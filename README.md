# Project in Python

The aim of this project is to code in Python 3 several games that we all know such as hangman or guessing a number between 0 and 10. To that extent, we will use dictionnaries, tests, and so on.

Games :
- Guessing a number between two boundaries
- Hangman
- Simulating gaussian curves

The file `english-common-words.csv`  shows the 3000 most used words in English. We will use it to randomly choose a word.

Files starting by `PyCon__.py` are codes coming from lectures of Python experts during the PyCon in 2013 or 2015.
